# Team Leader: Morning Tea

## Overview

> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching. \(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV\)

In our church's vision statement, we say that we want to be a church who ‘loves one-another’. We gather as church to encourage each other to trust in Jesus and live for him. Part of the way we do this at Gympie Presbyterian is by spending time together over morning tea. The purpose of morning tea isn’t the food or drinks, but it’s developing stronger relationships so we can say with the Apostle that we "share \[…\] not only the gospel of God but our lives as well." \(1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV\)

## Responsibilities

The responsibility of a team leader is to _recruit_ church members to serve in this ministry area, _train_ people to competently serve, and maintain a _roster_. It is also the team leaders job to ensure we have enough _supplies_ for morning tea.

#### Recruit

Being asked to serve around church is a way to help people like their part of the church family. Morning Tea is an area where people can serve even when they've been part of the church for a short while.

As _team leader,_ you are encouraged to invite people to join the morning tea team. Please let the elders know who've you've invited and whether they've accepted or rejected the invitation.

#### Train

New team members will require training in how to set up, serve, and clean-up, particularly following the COVID-Safe guidelines. The team leader is responsible to ensure that new team members are trained to understand how to make morning tea work. This [job description](../tasks/morning-tea.md) summarises the tasks which occur weekly as part of this role.

#### Roster

The morning tea team leader is responsible for rostering two people on to serve morning tea each week. You may either maintain the roster in our [Elvanto](https://gympiepc.elvanto.com.au/) database directly \(ask the minister to be trained in this\) or use another method and communicate the roster \(and changes\) to the minister for inclusion in [Elvanto](https://gympiepc.elvanto.com.au/).

#### Supplies

Our church provides

* Tea
* Coffee
* Sugar
* Disposable cups (both for hot and cold drinks)
* Cordial
* ~~Single-serve biscuits~~
* Cleaning supplies

for morning tea.

The team leader is responsible for stocking these supplies \(either personally or by delegation\). Our Church has an account with [Gympie Packaging](https://gympiepackaging.com.au) \(on Tozer Street\), where most supplies can be purchased.

## Reporting

The morning tea team leader reports to the Session, and is accountable to the Committee of Management for finances.
