# Team Leader: Welcoming

### Overview

> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching. \(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV\)

Church is the gathering of God's people, in the name of God's Son, to hear God's Word. We also meet to encourage each other \(Hebrews 10:24-25\).

Welcomers are not merely _greeters_. The job is more than just to hand things out, but it's to help people _feel_ welcome, whether it's their first or 500th time with us.

### Responsibilities

The responsibility of a team leader is to _recruit_ church members to serve in this ministry area, _train_ people to competently serve, and maintain a _roster_.

#### Recruit

Welcoming is part of the first impression people have of our church. So we need our welcoming team to be people who have know and love Jesus, have caught the vision of our church, and can portray this in the way they welcome people to church.

As _team leader,_ you are encouraged to consider people to join the welcome team. Please talk with an elder before inviting someone to join the team.

#### Train

New team members will require training in how to welcome people to church, particularly following the COVID-Safe guidelines. The team leader is responsible to ensure that new team members are trained to understand what is involved in welcoming. This [job description](../tasks/welcoming.md) summarises the tasks which occur weekly as part of this role.

#### Roster

The morning tea team leader is responsible for rostering two people on to welcome each week. You may either maintain the roster in our [Elvanto](https://gympiepc.elvanto.com.au/) database directly \(ask the minister to be trained in this\) or use another method and communicate the roster \(and changes\) to the minister for inclusion in [Elvanto](https://gympiepc.elvanto.com.au/).

#### Supplies

Our church provides hand wash and sanitiser. The team leader is responsible for ensuring we have enough of these supplies \(either personally or by delegation\). Please discuss reimbursement for purchases with the treasurer.

### Reporting

The welcome team leader reports to the Session.

### Review

The Session will review this ministry area at least annually.
