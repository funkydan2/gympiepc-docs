# Mowing

Regular mowing is important to give a positive first impression to visitors and newcomers.

In summer, mowing is rostered on a fortnightly basis. In winter, we only need to roster a someone each month.

During the month/fortnight youâ€™re rostered to mow, please mow as often as necessary to keep the churchyard presentable \(hopefully only once per fortnight/month\).

The church owns a mower and whipper-snipper. There are also ear-plugs provided for hearing protection. All the equipment needed for mowing is stored in the _shed_ which is between the two toilets. The padlock for the shed requires the same key as the toilets, which is hung on a nail just as you enter the hall.

When mowing near buildings and paths, please use the catcher. Place clippings under the mango tree, or in the wheelie bin, or, if you have a trailer, you can bring them to the manse.

If you need to purchase more two-stroke petrol, please keep the receipt and talk with the church treasurer \(Jennene\) about reimbursement. Any other expenses require _pre-approval_ by the treasurer.
