# Setup and Pack up

## Purpose

To create a safe, welcoming space for God's people \(and those not-yet-God's people\) to gather, to hear his Word, pray to him, praise him, and lovingly encourage each other to trust in and live for Jesus.

The role of _setup_ is to create this space. The role of _pack up_ is to show respect and care to the One Mile State School community, by leaving the hall in the same condition in which we found it.

## Details
