# Welcoming

## Purpose

Church is the gathering of God's people, in the name of God's Son, to hear God's Word. We also meet to encourage each other \(Hebrews 10:24-25\).

Welcomers are not merely _greeters_. The job is more than just to hand things out, but it's to help people _feel_ welcome, whether it's their first or 500th time with us.

## Details

### Before you arrive

* Be praying:
  * Before you come to church, be praying for regulars and newcomers, that they'll come, be encouraged, be converted, grow in Christ etc.
  * And keep praying as you welcome, and during the service!
* Be thinking about what you wear. You're part of the _first impression_ a new person has to our church.

### When you arrive

* Arrive at 9 am
* Put on a welcoming smile!
* Look around the auditorium:
  * Do windows need to be opened?
  * Do fans or heaters need to be turned on/off?
  * Are there unneccessary books or papers in the seats?
  * Are _both_ foyer doors opened?
* As people arrive:
  * Welcome them with a smile, a handshake, and say something like 'welcome to church'!
  * Hand them a bulletin. Sometimes there'll be other things to distribute, if that's the case, the minister or an elder will let you know.
  * Have a brief chat, but be mindful of the small foyer
    * Be careful to not only talk with your friends, but with everyone as they arrive. \(Though there are always some people who want to _sneak in_ unnoticed, and there's no need to make them feel uncomfortable!\)
* How to help _newcomers_
  * Introduce yourself
  * Ask them their name
  * Give them a small bit of information about our church:
    * Let them know where the bathrooms are
    * If they have children, tell them about Sunday School
    * Offer them a copy of _The Essential Jesus_ or one of the evangelistic tracts we have in the foyer. If they have children, there are copies of the _Good News Parcel Company_ DVD to give away.
  * Introduce them to another regular at church \(try to choose someone you think they'll find it easy to make conversation with\).
  * Show them to a seat _and introduce them to someone sitting nearby!_

### During the service

* Stay in the foyer until 9:35 or 9:40
* Count attendance
  * There's a small notebook to record attendance.
  * We count adults and children seperately.
    * Children means 'Primary School aged' - but if you don't know the age of a child, just have a guess!

### After the service

* Make note of newcomers, or people who looked down as they arrived, and make a priority to speak with them before you talk with your friends.
