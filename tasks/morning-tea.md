# Morning Tea

## Purpose

> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.\(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV\)

In our Church vision statement, we say that we want to be a church who ‘loves one-another’. We gather as the Church to encourage each other to trust in Jesus and live for him. Part of the way we do this at Gympie Presbyterian is by spending time together over morning tea after the service. The purpose of morning tea isn’t the food or drinks, but it’s developing stronger relationships so we can say with the Apostle that we "share \[…\] not only the gospel of God but our lives as well." \(1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV\)

## Job Description

To setup and clean up for morning tea after our churches service.

### Before the service:

* Arrive early \(around 9:00 am)
* Bring Morning Tea supply boxes from store room to kitchen.
* Put a bin liner (and a spare if needed) in the bin near the rear of the hall and in the kitchen.
* Wash hands
* Setup jug, cups, tea/coffee, biscuits etc. from the plastic storage tub \(stored in hall\)
* Fill plastic jug/s with water and/or cordial, and put in the fridge to cool.

### After service:

At least two people need to be rostered for morning tea. One will be responsible for serving drinks from the kitchen and the other serving food in the under-cover area.

#### Drinks

* During the final song, the person should go to the kitchen to boil the jug
* Wash/sanitise hands. Repeat regularly whilst serving drinks.
* Ensure when serving drinks that only the rostered person touches cups, stirrers, jog, and utensils.
* Encourage people to take their drink to the undercover area.

#### Food

* After the final song, together with the welcome team, clear the welcome table and take it to the under cover area to use for serving food.
* Wash/sanitise hands. Repeat regularly whilst serving drinks.
* Take food from kitchen to the under cover area.
* **Important:** under the [COVID Safe plan](https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/government-actions/approved-industry-covid-safe-plans/places-of-worship), we must not have a 'buffet' style morning tea. All food must be served by the rostered person, who regularly cleans their hands, preferably using tongs or other serving utensils to minimise touching food.

#### Cleaning up

* Pack away the folding table in the store room, wiping down if necessary.
* After cleaning the kitchen, pack supplies away and return to the store room.

## Reporting

Those serving with morning tea report to the [team leader](../team-leaders/morning-tea.md) who is responsible for recruiting, training, and rostering team members, and ensuring stock of morning tea and cleaning supplies.

## Some Special Notes:

### Allergies

There are a few people with food allergies in our church, including Celiac disease \(gluten\) and wheat allergies.

* We have a supply of individually wrapped gluten/lactose/egg-free biscuits. 
* Be mindful of cross-contamination. Keep cutlery and plates containing egg or gluten products away from the allergy specific foods.

### Church Lunch

On Sundays when we have a BYO church lunch, we'll still serve morning tea.

### Birthday Cake

We have a tradition of celebrating birthday’s on the first Sunday each month. On this Sunday, a birthday cake is normally made by Sylvia or Matthew Harris. If you’re rostered for morning tea on a first Sunday, you don’t need to provide much sweet food \(by ‘not much’ we really mean there’s no need for any other sweet snacks!\).

### Lord’s Supper

\(Check with minister or elder.\) When we have the Lord’s Supper, you may be required to bring bread. Four or five slices of white bread cut into small squares is enough. Grape juice is stored in the freezer and hopefully will have been defrosted before Sunday. You may be asked to help fill cups for the Lord’s Supper. Following the service, the glass cups require taking home to be washed.
