# Morning Tea

## Purpose

> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.\(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV\)

In our Church vision statement, we say that we want to be a church who ‘loves one-another’. We gather as the Church to encourage each other to trust in Jesus and live for him. Part of the way we do this at Gympie Presbyterian is by spending time together over morning tea after the service. The purpose of morning tea isn’t the food or drinks, but it’s developing stronger relationships so we can say with the Apostle that we "share \[…\] not only the gospel of God but our lives as well." \(1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV\)

## Job Description

To setup and clean up for morning tea after our churches service.

### Before the service:

Under COVID Safe guidelines, church provides individually wrapped biscuits, and serves hot and cold drinks in single-use cups.

* Arrive early \(around 9:15 am\)
* Wash hands
* Setup jug, cups, tea/coffee, biscuits etc. from the plastic storage tub \(stored in hall\).
* Fill plastic jug/s with water and/or cordial, and put in the fridge to cool.

### After service:

* Wash/sanitise hands.
* Ensure when serving food/drinks that only those rostered, who have sanitised hands, are touching food and utensils.
* Serve food and drinks in a way which eliminates people touching utensils other than their own.

## Some Special Notes:

### Allergies

There are a few people with food allergies in our church, including Celiac disease \(gluten\) and egg allergy.

* We have a supply of individually wrapped gluten/lactose/egg-free biscuits. 
* Be mindful of cross-contamination. Keep cutlery and plates containing egg or gluten products away from the allergy specific foods.

### Church Lunch

On Sundays when we have a BYO church lunch, we'll still serve morning tea.

### Birthday Cake \(currently on hold\)

We have a tradition of celebrating birthday’s on the first Sunday each month. On this Sunday, a birthday cake is normally made by Matthew Harris. If you’re rostered for morning tea on a first Sunday, you don’t need to provide much sweet food \(by ‘not much’ we really mean there’s no need for any other sweet snacks!\).

### Lord’s Supper \(currently using single-serve elements\)

\(Check with minister or elder.\) When we have the Lord’s Supper, you may be required to bring bread. Four or five slices of white bread cut into small squares is enough. Grape juice is stored in the freeze and hopefully will have been defrosted before Sunday. You may be asked to help fill cups for the Lord’s Supper. Following the service, the glass cups require washing.
