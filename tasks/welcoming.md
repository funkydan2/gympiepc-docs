# Welcoming

### Purpose

Church is the gathering of God's people, in the name of God's Son, to hear God's Word. We also meet to encourage each other \(Hebrews 10:24-25\).

Welcomers are not merely _greeters_. The job is more than just to hand things out, but it's to help people _feel_ welcome, whether it's their first or 500th time with us.

### Details

#### Before you arrive

* Be praying:
  * Before you come to church, be praying for regulars and newcomers, that they'll come, be encouraged, be converted, grow in Christ etc.
  * And keep praying as you welcome, and during the service!
* Be thinking about what you wear. You're part of the _first impression_ a new person has to our church.

#### When you arrive

* Arrive at 8:50 am
* Setup the welcoming table
  * Welcome box is in the side store room.
  * Folding tables are in the rear store room
  * Place giving box, notices, and other hand outs on the table
* Setup bathrooms & hand sanitiser
  * Place hand wash in both bathrooms.
  * Place hand sanitiser on the welcome table and morning tea area.
* Put up COVID safe signs
  * On welcome table
  * On all entry doors
* Look around the hall
  * Are chairs neatly arranged?
  * Does the fan need to be turned on/off?
* Put on a welcoming smile!

#### As people arrive:

* Welcome them with a smile and say something like 'welcome to church'!
* Ensure contact tracing details are taken down
  * Filling out the electronic form is preferred, though ticking off attendance or writing down details of visitors is fine.
* Hand them a bulletin. Sometimes there'll be other things to distribute, if that's the case, the minister or an elder will let you know.

#### How to help _newcomers_

* Introduce yourself
* Ask them their name
* Give them a small bit of information about our church:
  * Let them know where the bathrooms are,
  * If they have children, tell them about Sunday School,
  * Offer them a copy of _The Essential Jesus_ or an evangelistic tract. If they have children, there are copies of the _Good News Parcel Company_ DVD to give away.
* Introduce them to another regular at church \(try to choose someone you think they'll find it easy to make conversation with\).

#### During the service

* Stay at the welcome table until 9:35 or 9:40
* When you leave the welcome table, take the giving box to the front of the hall.

#### After the service

* Make note of newcomers or people who looked down as they arrived, and make a priority to speak with them before you talk with your friends.
* Help with packing up
  * Packup welcome table
  * Collect COVID signage from doors
  * Remove hand wash from bathrooms and sanitiser from morning tea area
  * Return welcome box to the side store room and the table to the rear store room.
