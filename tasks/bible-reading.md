# Bible Reading

## Purpose

> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. \([1 Timothy 4:13 NIV](https://ref.ly/1Tim4.13)\)

Church is the gathering of God's people _around God's word_. When we gather, one of the most important things we do is hear God speak. In the past, God spoke in many ways, and he speaks to us chiefly through Jesus \([Hebrews 1:1-2](https://ref.ly/Heb1.1-2)\). Through the Bible, God continues to speak \([1 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3.16)\).

In the _public reading_ of the Bible, we're not only aiming for words to be read and heard but for the Bible to be read in a way that helps _hearers_ understand. We're reading for _meaning_.

## Before Sunday \(Prepare!\)

So, you've just been asked to read the Bible at church this coming Sunday. What can you do to prepare?

1. Print out a copy of the Bible reading. Yes, you could start by reading from your favourite leather-bound Bible, but it's a good idea to print out a copy of the passage \(you can use [Bible Gateway\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-International-Version-NIV-Bible/#booklist). The reasons for this are \(1\) you can print with a large font to make reading easier, and \(2\) you can mark-up the printed text.
2. At church we use the New International Version, so make sure you're using the right version.
3. Read the passage out loud. As you do, ask yourself:
   1. Are there any [difficult names](bible-reading.md#difficult-names)?
   2. What is the big idea or main point of the passage? How can my reading help people hear this?
   3. What are the _emotions_ in the passage? Is it joyful, angry, sad, etc.? How can you read in a way to express this?
4. Think about the meaning of the passage. You may like to ask the preacher/minister or read a commentary to help you understand the main point and emotions of the passage.
5. Mark up the passage. Where should you pause? What words will you emphasise? Are there sections to read more quickly or slowly?
6. Read out loud _two or three more times_!

## At Church

1. Bring your marked-up Bible passage.
2. Arrive early - say around 15 minutes before the service. \(It helps the service leader not to panic!!\)
3. Test the microphone. If it's not turned on, or you think it won't be loud enough, check with the service leader about how to fix it.

For the Bible reading

1. Walk confidently to the microphone.
2. Start by saying where the Bible reading is found. For example, 

> The Bible reading is from 1 Kings 12, verses 25 to 33. It is on page 262 of the church bibles. 1 Kings 25, starting at verse 25.

1. When you pause, _wait for people to find the passage in their own bible_. Wait for the sound of pages rustling to die down. It may feel like you're waiting _for ever_, but it's not that long.
2. Speak confidently into the [microphone](bible-reading.md#using-a-microphone).

## A few tips

### Using a microphone

* Microphones _support_ your voice. They're not a replacement for clear, confident speech. So speak clearly into the microphone. Think as if you're projecting your voice to the back row.
* Get _close_. Most microphones work best when they're a few centimetres from your mouth. If you need to adjust the height or angle of the microphone stand, do it! It's better to take a moment to get the microphone right before you start reading, rather than having no-one able to hear God's word being read!
* Speak _into_ the microphone. I like to think of using a microphone as if I'm speaking down a long tube. So speak as if you're speaking _through_ the microphone.

### Difficult names

In the Bible, there are many unusual \(to us\) names of places and people. The most important thing to know about these names is _no-one knows the right way to say them!_, and this means there's no wrong way to pronounce them.

However, these strange words can still throw you when reading the Bible, so here are a few tips.

1. Prepare \(see above\). If you don't prepare by reading the passage through out-loud, not only will it be difficult to _read for meaning_ but if there are unusual words, you'll get caught out!
2. Have a go. Since no-one alive today knows the way these names were said, just have a go.
3. Have a listen. If you have access to an audio Bible, have a listen to hear how it's pronounced there. Once again, this isn't the _right_ way to read these words, and you'll sometimes find some differences between how Australians, Americans, and British people tend to say certain names \(you can notice this with well-known names like Isaiah\).
4. _Ask for help_. If the passage is going to be preached on, ask the preacher how he will pronounce the name \(not because he's right, but for consistency\).
