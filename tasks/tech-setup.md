### Turn on the Projector

1. Point the remote control to the front of the projector.
2. Press the red power button until the small green LED on the projector starts blinking or you see some light emitting from the lens.

### Getting Lyrics onto the Projector Screen

1. Start OpenLP

   ![OpenLP in the Dock](../.gitbook/assets/dock-openlp.png)

2. Double click on the first entry in the Service Manager. Normally this will be _Before Service_. ![Service Manager](../.gitbook/assets/openlp-service-manager.png)
3. This should start a loop of notices slides.
4. To select the first song, double click on the song title. \(You only need to do this to get out of the loop.\)
5. The service can be controlled from the laptop. The ↓ and ↑ arrows move through slides \(e.g. next/previous verse\) and the ← and → arrows move _between_ items \(i.e. previous/next song\).

### Controlling OpenLP from your Smart Phone

OpenLP can be controlled using your smartphone. All you need is a browser, though there is a dedicated app for both Android and iOS that is much easier to use.

1. Download the OpenLP app from the app store. [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openlp-remote/id1096218725?mt=8) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openlp.android2)
2. Connect your phone to the _GympiePresbyterian_ wifi network. The network name and password are written on a piece of cardboard which is found in the orange and black laptop bag. N.b. this network isn't connected to the internet, so you may not be able to access the internet on your phone/tablet whilst connected to this wifi network.
3. Start the OpenLP app. In the settings of the app, you need to enter the _Server IP_ address. Enter '192.168.1.11' as the _Server IP_ and '4316' as the _Port_.
4. You can now control OpenLP from your phone.

### Turning off the projector and laptop

1. Press the power button on the remote control twice.
2. Shutdown the Laptop by first quitting all applications, and then shut down the computer \(click `→Shutdown`\).

2. Click the blue ↓ or ↑ at the bottom of the Service Manager.

### How to Insert Songs \(OpenLP\)

1. Begin by typing the title of the song into the search box.
2. Select the song you wish to add.
3. Click the +button to add the song to Service Manager. \(If you double click on song title it will go to the Preview.\)
4. You can reorder the songs in the Service Manager by clicking the blue arrows.
