# Service Leading

## Philosophy of Ministry

Our aim for our church service is that it will be:

1. For believers \(Hebrews 10:24-25\) whilst also being understandable for non-believers \(1 Corinthians 14:20-25\)
2. Shaped by the gospel
3. Directed towards supporting the 'big idea' of the sermon

A few ways this shapes our practice are:

1. We'll use 'outsider friendly' language. We'll introduce ourself by name and welcome visitors—even if we can't see any. We won't use too many technical/jargon words or phrases \(or we'll explain them\)—this includes both theological terms and acronyms/shorthand ways of talking about what we do as a church. We don't assume everyone is a believer, so we'll be thinking about who the 'we' is when we speak.
2. The gospel shapes our service as we 
   1. come to God in repentance and faith \(Mark 1:15)
   2. sing to him with thankfulness \(Ephesians 5:19)
   3. cast our anxieties upon him \(1 Peter 5:7\)
   4. hear his voice in the reading, preaching, and teaching of his word \(1 Timothy 4:13\)
   5. respond to his voice with faith and obedience (John 10:27)
3. The 'big idea' of the sermon will shape things like the songs we sing, the topics covered in prayers etc.

## Job Description

The task of leading the service is to help the congregation connect with God and with each other so that through meeting together we might build one another up in Christ.

### Before Sunday

1. Be praying for Sunday! Pray that when we gather for church, believers will be encouraged and strengthened and that non-believers would come and hear the good news of Jesus. Be praying for the preacher and others who'll be involved 'upfront'.
2. Prepare a 'first prayer'. This prayer is usually a 'gospel prayer' where we praise God for who he is,  lead the congregation in confession and repentance, and remind ourselves of the assurance of forgiveness we have in Jesus.
3. Look over the order of service and consider how you might introduce songs and other parts of the service.

### On Sunday

1. Arrive around about half an hour before the service starts. This is a good time to check the microphone is working.
2. Check that people on the roster for 'upfront' roles \(e.g. Bible readers\) are present and prepared. 
3. About 15 minutes before the service, meet with the preacher, minister, and elders to pray.
4. **Start on time**. This is an important way to love and welcome newcomers and visitors. They normally arrive early, or on time, and are probably feeling a bit anxious waiting for things to start.
5. Start by welcoming people and introducing yourself—e.g. 'Good morning and welcome to Gympie Presbyterian Church. My name is Joe Bloggs, and it's great to have you with us, particularly if you are visiting or new today.'
6. After welcoming people, say something about God. This could be a verse from the Bible, or a summary of why we gather, or a question that relates to the sermon or something happening during the service.
7. If you're giving the notices, be brief and make sure you know what the announcement is about.
