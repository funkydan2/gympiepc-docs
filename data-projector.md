The laptop's resolution will now change (to no longer be widescreen). Shortly you should now see the laptop display *duplicated* on the projector screen, and the WPS application displayed as below.

1. Start OpenLP

   ![OpenLP in the Dock](.gitbook/assets/dock-openlp.png)

3. This should start a loop of notices slides.

4. To select the first song, double click on the song title. \(You only need to do this to get out of the loop.\)

5. The service can be controlled from the laptop. The ↓ and ↑ arrows move through slides (e.g. next/previous verse) and the ← and → arrows move *between* items (i.e. previous/next song).

## Controlling OpenLP from your Smart Phone

OpenLP can be controlled using your smart phone. All you need is a browser, but there is a dedicated app for both Android and iOS that is much easier to use.

1. Download the OpenLP app from the app store. [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openlp-remote/id1096218725?mt=8) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openlp.android2)
2. At church, connect your phone to the internal wifi network. The network name and password are written on peice of cardboard underneath the router. N.b. this network isn't connected to the internet, so you may not be able to access the internet on your phone/tablet whilst connected to this wifi network.
3. Start the OpenLP app. In the settings of the app, you need to enter the _Server IP_ address. Enter '192.168.1.11' as the _Server IP_ and '4316' as the _Port_.
4. You can now control OpenLP from your phone.

## Turning off the projector and laptop

1. Press the power button on the remote control twice.
2. Once the image is off the screen, and the fan stops within the projector, you can turn the power off at the switch in the entrance. \(Turning off the projector at the wall without following this procedure will cause the projector to overheat and shorten its lifespan.\)
3. Shutdown the Laptop by first quitting all applications, and then shutdown the computer (click `Apple→Shutdown`).
