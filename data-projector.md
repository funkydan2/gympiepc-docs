 3. This should start a loop of notices slides. 

4. To select the first song, double click on the song title. \(You only need to do this to get out of the loop.\) 

5. From then on you can move through the lyrics of the songs by pressing the down arrow.

## Controlling OpenLP from your Smart Phone

OpenLP can be controlled using your smart phone. All you need is a browser, but there is a dedicated app for both Android and iOS that is much easier to use.

1. Download the OpenLP app from the app store
2. At church, connect your phone to the internal wifi network. The network name and password are written on peice of cardboard underneath the router. N.b. this network isn't connected to the internet, so you may not be able to access the internet on your phone/tablet whilst connected to this wifi network.
3. Start the OpenLP app. In the settings of the app, you need to enter the _Server IP_ address. Enter '192.168.1.11' as the _Server IP_ and '4316' as the _Port_.
4. You can now control OpenLP from your phone.

## Turning off the projector

1. Press the power button on the remote control twice.
2. Once the image is off the screen, and the fan stops within the projector, you can turn the power off at the switch in the entrance. \(Turning off the projector at the wall without following this procedure will cause the projector to overheat and shorten its lifespan.\)

## How to Insert Songs in the ‘Service Manager’ of OpenLP

1. Begin by typing the title of the song into the search box. 
2. Select the song you wish to add. 
3. Click the +button to add the song to Service Manager. \(If you double click on song title it will go to the Preview.\)  
4. You can reorder the songs in the Service Managerby clicking the blue arrows.![](blob:https://gympie-presbyterian.gitbook.io/e4c2e56f-1a3c-4561-80d0-e4e13cf4903f)
