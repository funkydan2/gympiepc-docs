# Mowing

Regular mowing is import to give a positive first impression to visitors and newcomers.

In summer, mowing is rostered on a fortnightly basis, and monthly in winter. 

During the month/fortnight youâ€™re rostered to mow, please mow as often as necessary to keep the churchyard presentable \(hopefully only once per fortnight/month\). 

The church owns a mower and wiper-snipper. There are also ear-plugs provided for hearing protection.

When mowing near buildings and paths, please use the catcher. Place clippings under the mango tree, or in the wheelie bin, or, if you have a trailer, you can bring them to the manse.

If you need to purchase more two-stroke petrol, please keep the receipt and talk with the church treasurer \(Jennene\) about reimbursement.
