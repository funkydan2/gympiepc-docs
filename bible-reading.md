# Bible Reading

## Purpose
> 'Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.'
[1 Timothy 4:13 (NIV)](https://ref.ly/1Tim4.13)

Church is gathering of God's people _around God's word_. When we gather, one of the most important things we do is hear God speak. In the past, God spoke in many ways and he speaks to us cheifly through Jesus ([Hebrews 1:1-2](https://ref.ly/Heb1.1-2). Through the Bible, God continues to speak ([1 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3.16)).

In the _public reading_ of the Bible, we're not only aiming for words to be read and heard, but for the Bible to be read in way that helps _hearers_ understand. We're reading for _meaning_.
