# Morning Tea

## Purpose

> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.\(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV\)


In our Church vision statement, we say that we want to be a church who ‘loves one-another’. We gather as the Church to encourage each other to trust in Jesus and live for him. Part of the way we do this at Gympie Presbyterian is by spending time together over morning tea after the service. The purpose of morning tea isn’t the food or drinks, but it’s developing stronger relationships so we can say with the Apostle that we "share \[…\] not only the gospel of God but our lives as well." \(1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV\)

## Job Description

To setup and clean up for morning tea after our churches service.

### Before the service:

Church provides some biscuits and cakes. However, if you’d like to bring some other food for morning tea, please do.

* Arrive early \(around 9 am\)
* Fill urn and turn on \(set thermostat to ~80℃\) \(this is to get the water warm so it’s ready after the service\)
* Move table from hall to the verandah
* Setup cups: cups and mugs in kitchen and glasses on outside table
* Prepare food \(e.g. you may need to take out food which is stored in the freezer\)
* Ensure there are extra chairs on the verandah.

\(Some of these jobs may be done by others, but it’s your role to ensure it occurs.\)

### After service:

* Turn Urn thermostat up to 100℃
* Put food on the table. For allergy specific food, please make sure it's labelled and clearly separate.
* Serve hot drinks from kitchen.
* Wash up and put away cutlery and crockery.

## Some Special Notes:

AllergiesThere are a few people with food allergies in our church, including Celiac disease \(gluten\) and egg allergy. 

* We have a supply of gluten/lactose/egg-free biscuits. Since only a few people are allergic to these foods, please put out a few biscuits on a well labelled plate for those requiring this food. 
* Please be mindful of cross-contamination. Keep cutlery and plates containing egg or gluten products away from the allergy specific foods.

### Church Lunch

Most months, usually on the third Sunday of the month, we’ll have a church lunch. On this Sunday there’s no need for food to be provided for morning tea - hot & cold drinks and a packet of biscuits from the cupboard \(fridge\) is enough for morning tea as we’ll normally have lunch starting around 11:15.

### Birthday Cake

We have a tradition of celebrating birthday’s on the Sunday each month. On this Sunday, a birthday cake is normally made by Matthew Harris. If you’re rostered for morning tea on a first Sunday, you don’t need to provide much sweet food \(by ‘not much’ we really mean there’s no need for any other sweet snacks!\).

### Lord’s Supper

\(Check with minister or elder.\) When we have the Lord’s Supper, you may be required to bring bread. Four or five slices of white bread cut into small squares is enough. Grape juice is stored in the freeze and hopefully will have been defrosted before Sunday. You may be asked to help fill cups for the Lord’s Supper. Following the service, the glass cups require washing.
